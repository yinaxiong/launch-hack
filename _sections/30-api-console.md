title: Best Buy API Console & Query Builder

## API Console

The [**API Console**](https://remix.mashery.com/io-docs) provides an interface for you to explore our APIs directly from our documentation. You can try various queries while you learn what our APIs have to offer by interacting with our API Console. You will need your key to use the simulator and you can also use the tool to create example Products, Stores, Reviews and Categories queries, as well as a JSON callback function.

## Query Builder

We have created a application called [**BBY Query Mixer**](https://bestbuyapis.github.io/bby-query-mixer/app/). This sample AngularJS app allows you to build and execute queries. In addition it does the following:

- Demonstrates how to write queries against the Products API and Recommendations API
- Executes queries and shows results
- Shows sample AngularJS code and tests for using our tools
