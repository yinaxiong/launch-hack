title: 'How do I get started?'

## STEP 1 - Get a key
You will need to register for a key. To do this visit [**GET API Key**](https://remix.mashery.com/member/register) and complete your registration. We'll immediately send you an email with instructions on how to activate your new key. The whole process should take less than five minutes.

## STEP 2 - Create a query
After you activate your key, you can start accessing Best Buy's data with a basic GET request. To help you get started, here is an example using our [**Products API**](/documentation/products-api) for a specific product. The SKU for _Batman Begins (Blu-ray Disc)_ is 8880044, so you can retrieve it in the example below. The response will be returned as either JSON or XML depending on the extension specified in the URL.

_HINT: Don't forget to replace **YourAPIKey** with the API key that you received from us._
